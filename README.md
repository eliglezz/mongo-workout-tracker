## Description
Web app that allows a user to track their workouts. This fitness tracker front end was provided. I built out the model along with html and server routes. The web app uses Mongo DB for the database with express and mongoose packages. The web app is deployed on Heroku.<br>
## Installation
Fork the repo, Clone the repo. Run `npm i` in the terminal to get the necessary packages. Now run `node seeds` in the terminal to seed the database. After the user must `node server.js` to run the local server. The user should now be able to use the app localhost if they are running their own Mongo Database.<br>
